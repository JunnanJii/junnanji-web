    <p id="you">The initial aim of Buy For 秃 was to promote the Buy42 charity shop to young people. We hope to attract more people to join the warm family of Buy42. We chose to use the "bald" and "two" sounding stems in the hope that they would resonate with people. To emphasise the concept of a charity shop, the stars in the film symbolise that every item has its own value and that Buy42 brightens up our lives.

        In the film, the main character, Baldy, spends his days tapping away at the keyboard, his workload making him lose his smile. Suddenly, one day he receives an invitation to volunteer at Buy42 and without hesitation, he comes to Buy42, where he sorts out donations and receives payments from customers under the stars, and in the process, Baldy feels his value, he feels that what he is doing is meaningful, and gradually he is healed and gains a sense of happiness and fulfilment. We want to use his experience to encourage more young people to step away from the drudgery of work and find a place to bring their values into play. We hope that this short film will bring you joy and resonate with you.</p>
